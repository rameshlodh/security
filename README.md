## This is a reusable security flow that can be integrated with any other project across GitHub.

### This flow currently includes two security tools:

### 1.semgrep
A fast, open-source static analysis tool for finding bugs, vulnerabilities, and enforcing code quality policies in your codebase. It supports multiple languages and provides customizable rules.

### 2.Checkov
A static code analysis tool designed for scanning Terraform and cloud infrastructure code for security misconfigurations. It helps enforce best practices and compliance standards for your infrastructure-as-code.

## Benefits:
**Scalable:** Can be integrated with any GitHub repository for automated security checks.
<br>

**Customizable:** Easily extendable with additional tools or rules as your security requirements evolve.
<br>

**Continuous Monitoring:** Ensures ongoing security compliance with every change pushed to the repository.

<p>
By incorporating these tools into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure a more secure and compliant codebase, proactively identifying potential issues before they become problems.
